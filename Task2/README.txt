Task 2
CHECKERS
You will implement an AI agent that can solve a checkers endgame puzzle, where the agent uses minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and any additional techniques of your choosing. Your agent will return the best move possible, given the endgame puzzle we provide and the time available.

Your program needs to return the best move possible, given the input layout that we provide. This move will be represented by the 8x8 board layout that will result once your AI completes its move.
