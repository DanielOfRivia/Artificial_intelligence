CHECKERS
I implemented an AI agent that can solve a checkers endgame puzzle, where the agent uses minimax and alpha-beta pruning. The agent returns the best move possible, given the endgame puzzle and the time available.

The program returns the best move possible, given the input layout provided. This move will be represented by the 8x8 board layout that will result once AI completes its move.

To validate the script follow the instructions inside checkers_validate.py file
